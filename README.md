# western_pa_climate_Tableau
Two .csv files for use with the Tableau workbook for this project - I connected directly to my PostgreSQL database, but these should replicate the experience.
In Tableau, stations.csv should be set as the parent table, with a one-to-many relationship with the other table, which contains the vast majority of the data.
